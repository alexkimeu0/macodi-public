                    One day my employer decided to send me as a spy to find out the prices of fish and fish 
                    food at a competitive fish shop. I tried to behave like a casual customer and walked 
                    coolly into the competitor’s shop and gradually began to ask the prices of fish and 
                    fish food. After I had found out what was needed I bought a pair of cheap Black Mollies 
                    from his shop just to show him that I was a genuine customer. From the information I got,
                    we found Ashok’s to be comparatively cheaper than the competitor.
                    During this period I improved my knowledge about aquarium fish tremendously. 
                    This was mainly due to two things. Firstly, I had spent a lot of time observing the fish 
                    at Ashok’s shop and getting practical experience from the places we visited.
                    Secondly, I had been reading the fish books that my father bought for me as a gift for 
                    getting a distinction in my SSC exam. The books were quite expensive but well worth the 
                    cost. Being able to get theoretical knowledge and practical experience at the same time 
                    gave me a lot of confidence with regard to aquarium fish.
                    One of the important highlights of my experience at Ashok’s was learning to make fish 
                    tanks. Ashok told me that since we were going through a slack period, 
                    he would teach me how to make fish tanks. I had to start from basics which meant 
                    purchasing glass for six tanks, having the glass pieces cut to specifications and then 
                    having the pieces delivered at the shop without a scratch.
